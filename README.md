# vue-flickr

> A small project to learn Vue.js by building a Flickr feed viewer. Live at [vue-flickr.herokuapp.com](http://vue-flickr.herokuapp.com). Shows you the public Flickr feed, allowing you to filter by tags and view the images either in a modal or on Flickr's site.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
